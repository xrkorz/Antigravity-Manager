## 🌟 Detailed Feature Matrix

### 1. 🎛️ Smart Account Dashboard
*   **Global Real-time Monitoring**: Instant insight into the health of all accounts, including average remaining quotas for Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash, Claude, and Gemini Image generation.
*   **Smart Recommendation**: The system uses a real-time algorithm to filter and recommend the "Best Account" based on quota redundancy, supporting **one-click switching**.
*   **Active Account Snapshot**: Visually displays the specific quota percentage and the last synchronization time of the currently active account.

### 2. 🔐 Professional AI Account Management & Proxy System (v3.3.27)
*   **OAuth 2.0 Authorization (Auto/Manual)**: Pre-generates a copyable authorization URL so you can finish auth in any browser; after the callback, the app auto-completes and saves the account (use “I already authorized, continue” if needed).
*   **Multi-dimensional Import**: Supports single token entry, JSON batch import, and automatic hot migration from V1 legacy databases.
*   **Gateway-level Views**: Supports switching between "List" and "Grid" views. Provides 403 Forbidden detection, automatically marking and skipping accounts with permission anomalies.

### 3.  Protocol Conversion & Relay (API Proxy)
*   **Multi-Protocol Adaptation (Multi-Sink)**:
    *   **OpenAI Format**: Provides `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, compatible with 99% of existing AI apps.
    *   **Anthropic Format**: Provides native `/v1/messages` interface, supporting all features of **Claude Code CLI** (e.g., chain-of-thought, system prompts).
    *   **Gemini Format**: Supports direct calls from official Google AI SDKs.
*   **Smart Self-healing**: When a request encounters `429 (Too Many Requests)` or `401 (Expired)`, the backend triggers **millisecond-level automatic retry and silent rotation**, ensuring business continuity.

### 4. 🔀 Model Router Center
*   **Series-based Mapping**: Classify complex original model IDs into "Series Groups" (e.g., routing all GPT-4 requests uniformly to `gemini-3-pro-high`).
*   **Expert Redirection**: Supports custom regex-level model mapping for precise control over every request's landing model.
*   **Tiered Routing [New]**: Automatically prioritizes models based on account tiers (Ultra/Pro/Free) and reset frequencies to ensure stability for high-volume users.
*   **Silent Background Downgrading [New]**: Intelligently identifies background tasks (e.g., Claude CLI title generation) and reroutes them to Flash models to preserve premium quota.

### 5. 🎨 Multimodal & Imagen 3 Support
*   **Advanced Image Control**: Supports precise control over image generation tasks via OpenAI `size` (e.g., `1024x1024`, `16:9`) parameters or model name suffixes.
*   **Enhanced Payload Support**: The backend supports payloads up to **100MB**, more than enough for 4K HD image recognition and processing.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### macOS says "App is damaged"?
Due to macOS security gatekeeper, non-App Store apps might show this. Run this in Terminal to fix:
```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Antigravity Tools.app"
```

## 🔌 Quick Integration Examples

### 🔐 OAuth Authorization Flow (Add Account)
1. Go to `Accounts` → `Add Account` → `OAuth`.
2. The dialog pre-generates an authorization URL before you click any button. Click the URL to copy it to the system clipboard, then open it in the browser you prefer and complete authorization.
3. After consent, the browser opens a local callback page and shows “✅ Authorized successfully!”.
4. The app automatically continues the flow and saves the account; if it doesn’t, click “I already authorized, continue” to finish manually.

> Note: the auth URL contains a one-time local callback port. Always use the latest URL shown in the dialog. If the app isn’t running or the dialog is closed during auth, the browser may show `localhost refused connection`.

### How to use with Claude Code CLI?
1. Start Antigravity service in the "API Proxy" tab.
2. In your terminal:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-antigravity"
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8045"
claude
```

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini-3-flash",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, please introduce yourself"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 📝 Developer & Community

*   **Changelog**:
    *   **v3.3.36 (2026-01-17)**:
        - **Core Stability Fixes for Claude Protocol**:
            - **"Reply OK" Loop Fix (History Poisoning)**:
                - **Root Cause**: Fixed a critical flaw in `is_warmup_request` logic. The old logic scanned the last 10 historical messages; once any "Warmup" message appeared in history (user-sent or background heartbeat), the system would misidentify all subsequent user inputs (like "continue") as Warmup requests and force an "OK" response.
                - **Fix**: Restricted detection scope to check ONLY the **latest** message. Now valid user inputs are processed correctly, and only actual Warmup heartbeats are intercepted.
                - **Impact**: Significantly improved usability for Claude Code CLI and Cherry Studio in long-running sessions.
            - **Cache Control Injection Fix (Fix Issue #744)**:
                - **Root Cause**: Claude clients injected non-standard `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` fields into Thinking blocks, causing Google API to return `Extra inputs are not permitted` 400 errors.
                - **Fix**: Implemented a global recursive cleanup function `clean_cache_control_from_messages` and integrated it into the Anthropic (z.ai) forwarding path, ensuring all `cache_control` fields are stripped before sending to upstream APIs.
            - **Comprehensive Signature Defense**:
                - **Implicit Fixes**: Deep code audit confirmed that a series of previously reported signature-related issues (#755, #654, #653, #639, #617) are effectively resolved by the **strict signature validation**, **automatic downgrade**, and **Base64 smart decoding** mechanisms introduced in v3.3.35. The system now has high fault tolerance for missing, corrupted, or malformed signatures.
        - **Smart Warmup Logic Fix (Fix Issue #760)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed legacy logic in the auto-warmup scheduler that incorrectly mapped `gemini-2.5-flash` quota status to `gemini-3-flash`.
            - **Symptom**: This caused "ghost warmups" where `gemini-3-flash` was triggered for warmup even when it had 0% quota, just because `gemini-2.5-flash` (unused/different bucket) reported 100%.
            - **Fix**: Removed all hardcoded `2.5 -> 3` mapping logic. The scheduler now strictly checks the quota percentage of the specific model itself, triggering warmup only when that actual model reports 100%.
        - **Gemini 2.5 Pro Model Removal (Fix Issue #766)**:
            - **Reason**: Due to reliability issues, the `gemini-2.5-pro` model has been removed from the supported list.
            - **Migration**: All `gpt-4` family aliases (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o`) have been remapped to `gemini-2.5-flash` to ensure service continuity.
            - **Impact**: Users previously accessing `gemini-2.5-pro` via aliases will be automatically routed to `gemini-2.5-flash`. The model is no longer selectable in the frontend.
        - **CLI Sync Safety & Backup (Fix Issue #756 & #765)**:
            - **Smart Backup & Restore**: Implemented an automatic backup mechanism. Before syncing, the system now automatically backs up existing configurations to `.antigravity.bak`. The "Restore" feature intelligently detects these backups and offers to restore the original user configuration instead of just resetting to defaults.
            - **Safety Confirmation**: Added a confirmation dialog for the "Sync Config" action to prevent accidental overwrites of local configurations.
            - **Enhanced CLI Detection**: Improved the detection logic for CLIs (like Claude Code) on macOS to correctly identify and execute binaries even if they are not in the system `PATH` but exist in standard fallback locations.
        - **Windows Console Flashing Fix (PR #769, Thanks to @i-smile)**:
            - **No Window Execution**: Fixed the issue where running CLI sync commands (like `where` checks) on Windows would briefly pop up a console window. Added `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` flag to ensure all background checks run silently.
        - **Auth UI Status Fix (PR #769, Thanks to @i-smile)**:
            - **Accurate Status**: Corrected the authentication status display logic in the API Proxy page. The UI now correctly shows "Disabled" when `auth_mode` is set to `off`, instead of incorrectly showing "Enabled".
    *   **v3.3.35 (2026-01-16)**:
        - **Major CLI Sync Enhancements**:
            - **Multi-config File Support**: Now supports syncing multiple configuration files for each CLI (Claude Code: `settings.json`, `.claude.json`; Codex: `auth.json`, `config.toml`; Gemini: `.env`, `settings.json`, `config.json`), ensuring a more complete setup.
            - **Claude No-Login Privilege**: Automatically injects `"hasCompletedOnboarding": true` into `~/.claude.json` during sync, allowing users to skip the initial onboarding/login steps for Claude CLI.
            - **Tabbed Config Viewer**: Upgraded the configuration viewer modal to a tabbed interface, enabling smooth switching between all associated config files for a single CLI.
        - **Deep UI/UX Refinements**:
            - **Unified Dialog Experience**: Replaced the native browser `window.confirm` for "Restore Default Configuration" with the app's themed `ModalDialog`.
            - **Icon & Badge Optimization**: Updated the restore button icon to `RotateCcw`, and streamlined status badge text with `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent layout breaks in tight spaces.
            - **Condensed Version Display**: Improved version extraction to display only pure numeric versions (e.g., v0.86.0) for a cleaner UI.
        - **Claude Thinking Signature Persistence Fix (Fix Issue #752)**:
            - **Root Cause**: 
                - **Response Collection**: The streaming response collector (`collector.rs`) in v3.3.34 missed the `signature` field of `thinking` blocks when processing `content_block_start` events, causing signature loss.
                - **Request Transformation**: Historical message signatures were sent to Gemini without validation, causing `Invalid signature in thinking block` errors during cross-model switches or cold starts.
            - **Fix Details**: 
                - **Response Collector**: Added logic to extract and persist the `signature` field in `collector.rs`, with unit test `test_collect_thinking_response_with_signature`.
                - **Request Transformer**: Implemented strict signature validation in `request.rs`. Only cached and compatible signatures are used. Unknown or incompatible signatures cause thinking blocks to downgrade to plain text, preventing invalid signatures from being sent.
                - **Fallback Mechanism**: Implemented intelligent fallback retry logic. If signature validation fails or the upstream API rejects the request (400 error), the system automatically clears all thinking blocks and forces a retry, ensuring the user's request always succeeds.
            - **Impact**: Completely resolved `Invalid signature in thinking block` errors, supporting cross-model switches and cold start scenarios, ensuring Thinking models work stably in all modes.
        - **API Monitor Real-time Sync Fix (Pull Request #747, Thanks to @xycxl)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed issues with duplicate log entries and inaccurate counters in the API Monitor page caused by duplicate event listener registration and state desynchronization.
            - **Fix Details**:
                - **Data Deduplication**: Introduced `pendingLogsRef` and ID deduplication mechanisms to completely eliminate duplicate entries in the log list.
                - **Precise Counting**: Implemented strict frontend-backend state synchronization; the system now fetches authoritative `totalCount` from the backend with every new log batch, ensuring accurate pagination and total counts.
                - **Debounce Optimization**: Optimized log update debounce logic to reduce React re-renders and improve page smoothness.
                - **Feature Renaming**: Renamed "Call Records" to "Traffic Logs" and reverted the route to `/monitor` for a more intuitive experience.
    *   **v3.3.34 (2026-01-16)**:
        - **OpenAI Codex/Responses Protocol Fix (Fix Issue #742)**:
            - **400 Invalid Argument Complete Fix**:
                - **Root Cause**: The `/v1/responses` and other proprietary endpoints caused Gemini to receive empty bodies when the request body contained only `instructions` or `input` but lacked the `messages` field, as the transformation logic didn't cover all scenarios.
                - **Fix Details**: Backported the "request normalization" logic from the Chat interface to `handle_completions`. The system now forcibly detects Codex-specific fields (`instructions`/`input`), and even if `messages` is empty or missing, automatically transforms them into standard System/User message pairs, ensuring legal upstream requests.
            - **429/503 Advanced Retry & Account Rotation Support**:
                - **Logic Alignment**: Fully ported the "Smart Exponential Backoff" and "Multi-dimensional Account Rotation" strategies validated in the Claude processor to the OpenAI Completions interface.
                - **Effect**: Now, when the Codex interface encounters rate limiting or server overload, it automatically executes millisecond-level switching instead of throwing an error directly, greatly improving the stability of tools like VS Code plugins.
            - **Session Stickiness Support**:
                - **Feature Expansion**:completed the `session_id` extraction and scheduling logic under the OpenAI protocol. Now, whether it's Chat or Codex interface, as long as it's the same conversation, the system will try its best to schedule it to the same Google account.
                - **Performance Bonus**: This will significantly increase the hit rate of Google Prompt Caching, thereby drastically speeding up response times and saving computing resources.
        - **Claude Thinking Signature Encoding Fix (Fix Issue #726)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed a regression introduced in v3.3.33, where the already Base64-encoded `thoughtSignature` was incorrectly re-encoded in Base64. This doubled encoding caused Google Vertex AI to fail signature verification, returning an `Invalid signature` error.
            - **Fix Details**: Removed redundant Base64 encoding steps in the `Thinking`, `ToolUse`, and `ToolResult` processing logic, ensuring the signature is passed through to the upstream in its original valid format.
            - **Impact**: Completely resolved the 400 signature error triggered when using Thinking models (e.g., Claude 4.5 Opus / Sonnet) in multi-turn conversations, as well as the resulting "Error searching files" infinite loop (Issue #737).
        - **API Monitor Refresh Fix (Fix Issue #735)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed the issue where new requests were not automatically appearing in the API Monitor list due to a Closure-related bug in the event listener.
            - **Fix Details**: Optimized the event buffering logic using `useRef`, added a manual Refresh button as a backup, and explicitly enabled Tauri event permissions.
        - **Strict Grouped Quota Protection Fix (Core Thanks to @Mag1cFall PR #746)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed an issue where quota protection failed in strict matching mode due to case sensitivity and missing frontend UI key mapping. Previously, UI shorthand keys like `gemini-pro` could not match the backend-defined `gemini-3-pro-high` strict group.
            - **Fix Details**:
                - **Instant Case Normalization**: Restored case-insensitive matching in backend `normalize_to_standard_id`, ensuring variants like `Gemini-3-Pro-High` are correctly recognized.
                - **Smart UI Key Mapping**: Added automatic mapping for UI column names like `gemini-pro/flash` in frontend `isModelProtected`, ensuring lock icons correctly reflect backend protection status.
            - **Impact**: Completely resolved lock icon display issues for Gemini 3 Pro/Flash and Claude 4.5 Sonnet in strict grouping mode, ensuring intuitive visual feedback when quotas are exhausted.
        - **OpenAI Protocol Usage Statistics Fix (Pull Request #749, Thanks to @stillyun)**:
            - **Root Cause**: During OpenAI protocol conversion, Gemini's `usageMetadata` was not mapped to the `usage` field in OpenAI format, causing clients like Kilo to show zero token usage.
            - **Fix Details**:
                - **Data Model Completion**: Added standard `usage` field to `OpenAIResponse`.
                - **Full-Chain Mapping**: Implemented logic to extract and map `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, and `total_tokens` from both streaming (SSE) and non-streaming responses.
            - **Impact**: Completely resolved the issue where tools like Kilo Editor and Claude Code could not track token usage when using the OpenAI protocol.
        - **Linux Theme Switch Crash Fix (Pull Request #750, Thanks to @infinitete)**:
            - **Fix Details**:
                - Disabled incompatible `setBackgroundColor` calls on Linux platform.
                - Disabled View Transition API for WebKitGTK environments to prevent transparent window crashes.
                - Automatically adjusted GTK window alpha channel at startup for enhanced stability.
            - **Impact**: Resolved potential program freezes or hard crashes for Linux users when switching between dark/light modes.
    *   **v3.3.33 (2026-01-15)**:
        - **Codex Compatibility & Model Mapping Fix (Fix Issue #697)**:
            - **Instructions Parameter Support**: Fixed the handling of the `instructions` parameter, ensuring it is correctly injected as System Instructions for better compatibility with tools like Codex.
            - **Automatic Responses Format Detection**: Added intelligent detection in the OpenAI handler to automatically recognize and transform `instructions` or `input` fields into Responses mode.
            - **Model Mapping Restoration & Normalization**: Restored the logic that normalizes `gemini-3-pro-low/high/pro` to the internal alias `gemini-3-pro-preview`, with proper restoration to the physical `high` model name for upstream requests.
            - **Opus Mapping Enhancement**: Optimized default mappings to recognize `opus` keywords and ensure they route to the high-performance Pro preview tier by default.
        - **OpenAI Tool Call ID & Reasoning Content Fix (Fix Issue #710)**:
            - **Preserve Tool Call ID**: Resolved the issue where `tool_use.id` was lost during OpenAI format conversion, ensuring both `functionCall` and `functionResponse` retain original IDs, fixing the `Field required` error when calling Claude models.
            - **Native Reasoning Support**: Added support for the `reasoning_content` field in OpenAI messages, correctly mapping it to internal `thought` blocks and injecting chain-of-thought signatures.
            - **Tool Response Optimization**: Fixed redundant part conflicts in `tool` role messages, ensuring strict compliance with upstream payload validation.
        - **External Provider Smart Fallback Fix (Fix Issue #703)**: Fixed the issue where "Fallback only" mode failed to automatically switch to external providers when Google account quotas were exhausted.
            - **Core Problem**: The original logic only checked if the number of Google accounts was 0, without checking account availability (rate-limit status, quota protection status), causing direct 429 errors when accounts existed but were unavailable.
            - **Solution**: Implemented smart account availability checking mechanism. Added `has_available_account()` method in `TokenManager` to comprehensively assess account rate-limit and quota protection status.
            - **Modified Files**:
                - `token_manager.rs`: Added `has_available_account()` method to check for available accounts that are not rate-limited or quota-protected
                - `handlers/claude.rs`: Optimized Fallback mode logic from simple `google_accounts == 0` to intelligent availability check
            - **Behavior Improvement**: When all Google accounts are unavailable due to rate-limiting, quota protection, or other reasons, the system automatically switches to external providers, achieving true smart fallback.
            - **Impact**: This fix ensures external providers (e.g., Zhipu API) "Fallback only" mode works correctly, significantly improving service availability in multi-account scenarios.
        - **Quota Protection Model Name Normalization Fix (Fix Issue #685)**: Fixed the issue where quota protection failed due to model name mismatches.
            - **Core Problem**: Model names returned by the Quota API (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`) didn't match the standard names in the UI (e.g., `gemini-3-flash`), causing string matching failures and preventing protection triggers.
            - **Solution**: Implemented a unified model name normalization engine `normalize_to_standard_id`, mapping all physical model names to three standard protection IDs:
                - `gemini-3-flash`: All Flash variants (1.5-flash, 2.5-flash, 3-flash, etc.)
                - `gemini-3-pro-high`: All Pro variants (1.5-pro, 2.5-pro, etc.)
                - `claude-sonnet-4-5`: All Claude Sonnet variants (3.5-sonnet, sonnet-4-5, etc.)

            - **Multi-language Support**: Complete internationalization translations added for all 6 supported languages (Simplified Chinese, English, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, Vietnamese).
    *   **v3.3.29 (2026-01-14)**:
        - **OpenAI Streaming Function Call Support Fix (Fix Issue #602, #614)**:
            - **Background**: OpenAI interface streaming responses (`stream: true`) lacked Function Call processing logic, preventing clients from receiving tool call information.
            - **Root Cause**: The `create_openai_sse_stream` function only handled text content, thinking content, and images, completely missing `functionCall` processing.
            - **Fix Details**:
                - Added tool call state tracking variable (`emitted_tool_calls`) to prevent duplicate sends
                - Added `functionCall` detection and conversion logic in parts loop
                - Built OpenAI-compliant `delta.tool_calls` array

    *   **v3.3.26 (2026-01-13)**:
        - **Quota Protection & Scheduling Optimization (Fix Issue #595 - Zero Quota Accounts in Queue)**:
            - **Quota Protection Logic Refactor**: Fixed the issue where quota protection failed due to reliance on non-existent `limit/remaining` fields. It now directly uses the `percentage` field, ensuring that accounts are immediately disabled if any monitored model (e.g., Claude 4.5 Sonnet) falls below the threshold.
            - **Priority Algorithm Upgrade**: Account scheduling priority is no longer solely based on subscription tiers. Within the same tier (Ultra/Pro/Free), the system now prioritizes accounts with the **highest maximum remaining percentage**, preventing "squeezing" of near-empty accounts and significantly reducing 429 errors.
            - **Enhanced Protection Logs**: Logs when quota protection is triggered now explicitly state which model triggered the threshold (e.g., `quota_protection: claude-sonnet-4-5 (0% <= 10%)`), facilitating troubleshooting.
        - **MCP Tool Compatibility Enhancement (Fix Issue #593)**:
            - **Deep cache_control Cleanup**: Implemented multi-layer `cache_control` field cleanup mechanism, completely resolving "Extra inputs are not permitted" errors caused by `cache_control` in thinking blocks when using tools like Chrome Dev Tools MCP.

                - **Recursive Deep Cleanup**: Added `deep_clean_cache_control()` function to recursively traverse all nested objects and arrays, removing `cache_control` fields from any location.
                - **Final Safety Net**: Performs deep cleanup again after building Gemini request body and before sending, ensuring no `cache_control` fields are sent to Antigravity.
            - **Smart Tool Output Compression**: Added `tool_result_compressor` module to handle oversized tool outputs, reducing 429 error probability caused by excessive prompt length.
                - **Browser Snapshot Compression**: Automatically detects and compresses browser snapshots exceeding 20,000 characters, using head (70%) + tail (30%) retention strategy with middle omission.
                - **Large File Notice Compression**: Intelligently identifies "exceeds maximum allowed tokens" pattern, extracts key information (file path, character count, format description), significantly reducing redundant content.
                - **General Truncation**: Truncates tool outputs exceeding 200,000 characters with clear truncation notices.
                - **Base64 Image Removal**: Automatically removes base64-encoded images from tool results to avoid excessive size.
            - **Complete Test Coverage**: Added 7 unit tests covering text truncation, browser snapshot compression, large file notice compression, tool result cleanup, and other core functionalities, all passing validation.
            - **Impact**: This update significantly improves stability for MCP tools (especially Chrome Dev Tools MCP), resolving API errors caused by `cache_control` fields in thinking blocks, while reducing 429 error probability through smart compression of oversized tool outputs.
        - **API Monitor Account Information Recording Fix**:

        - **Comprehensive Logging System Optimization (Issue #241 Fix)**:
            - **Log Level Optimization**: Downgraded high-frequency debug logs for tool calls and parameter remapping from `info!` to `debug!`, dramatically reducing log output volume.
            - **Automatic Cleanup Mechanism**: Application startup now automatically cleans up log files older than 7 days, preventing indefinite log accumulation.
            - **Significant Impact**: Log file size reduced from 130GB/day to < 100MB/day, a **99.9%** reduction in log output.
            - **Scope**: Modified 21 log level statements in `streaming.rs` and `response.rs`, added `cleanup_old_logs()` automatic cleanup function.
    *   **v3.3.15 (2026-01-04)**:
        - **Claude Protocol Compatibility Enhancements** (Based on PR #296 by @karasungur + Issue #298 Fix):
            - **Fixed Opus 4.5 First Request Error (Issue #298)**: Extended signature pre-flight validation to all first-time thinking requests, not just function call scenarios. When using models like `claude-opus-4-5-thinking` for the first request, if there's no valid signature, the system automatically disables thinking mode to avoid API rejection, resolving the "Server disconnected without sending a response" error.
            - **Function Call Signature Validation (Issue #295)**: Added pre-flight signature validation. When thinking is enabled but function calls lack a valid signature, thinking is automatically disabled to prevent Gemini 3 Pro from rejecting requests.
            - **cache_control Cleanup (Issue #290)**: Implemented recursive deep cleanup to remove `cache_control` fields from all nested objects/arrays, resolving Anthropic API (z.ai mode) "Extra inputs are not permitted" errors.
            - **Tool Parameter Remapping**: Automatically corrects parameter names used by Gemini (Grep/Glob: `query` → `pattern`, Read: `path` → `file_path`), resolving Claude Code tool call validation errors.
            - **Configurable Safety Settings**: Added `GEMINI_SAFETY_THRESHOLD` environment variable supporting 5 safety levels (OFF/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/NONE), defaulting to OFF for backward compatibility.
            - **Effort Parameter Support**: Supports Claude API v2.0.67+ `output_config.effort` parameter, allowing fine-grained control over model reasoning effort.
            - **Opus 4.5 Default Thinking**: Aligned with Claude Code v2.0.67+, Opus 4.5 models now enable thinking mode by default, with signature validation for graceful degradation.
            - **Retry Jitter Optimization**: Added ±20% random jitter to all retry strategies to prevent thundering herd effect, improving stability in high-concurrency scenarios.
            - **Signature Capture Improvement**: Immediately captures signatures from thinking blocks, reducing signature missing errors in multi-turn conversations.
            - **Impact**: These improvements significantly enhance compatibility and stability for Claude Code, Cursor, Cherry Studio and other clients, especially in Opus 4.5 models, tool calling, and multi-turn conversation scenarios.
    *   **v3.3.14 (2026-01-03)**:
        - **Claude Protocol Robustness Improvements** (Core Thanks to @karasungur PR #289):
            - **Thinking Block Signature Validation Enhancement**:
                - Support for empty thinking blocks with valid signatures (trailing signature scenario)
                - Invalid signature blocks gracefully degrade to text instead of being dropped, preserving content to avoid data loss
                - Enhanced debugging logs for signature issue troubleshooting
            - **Tool/Function Calling Compatibility Optimization**:
                - Extracted web search fallback model to named constant `WEB_SEARCH_FALLBACK_MODEL` for improved maintainability
                - Automatically skips googleSearch injection when MCP tools are present to avoid conflicts
                - Added informative logging for debugging tool calling scenarios
                - **Important Note**: Gemini Internal API does not support mixing `functionDeclarations` and `googleSearch`
            - **SSE Parse Error Recovery Mechanism**:
                - Added `parse_error_count` and `last_valid_state` tracking for streaming response error monitoring
                - Implemented `handle_parse_error()` for graceful stream degradation
                - Implemented `reset_error_state()` for post-error recovery
                - Implemented `get_error_count()` for error count retrieval
                - High error rate warning system (>5 errors) for operational monitoring
                - Detailed debugging logs supporting troubleshooting of corrupted streams
            - **Impact**: These improvements significantly enhance stability for Claude CLI, Cursor, Cherry Studio and other clients, especially in multi-turn conversations, tool calling, and streaming response scenarios.
        - **Dashboard Statistics Fix** (Core Thanks to @yinjianhong22-design PR #285):
            - **Fixed Low Quota Statistics False Positives**: Fixed the issue where disabled accounts (403 status) were incorrectly counted in "Low Quota" statistics
            - **Logic Optimization**: Added `is_forbidden` check in `lowQuotaCount` filter to exclude disabled accounts
            - **Data Accuracy Improvement**: Dashboard now accurately reflects the true number of low-quota active accounts, avoiding false positives
            - **Impact**: Improved dashboard data accuracy and user experience, allowing users to more clearly understand which accounts need attention.
    *   **v3.3.13 (2026-01-03)**:
        - **Thinking Mode Stability Fixes**:
            - **Fixed Empty Thinking Content Error**: When clients send empty Thinking blocks, they are now automatically downgraded to plain text blocks to avoid `thinking: Field required` errors.
            - **Fixed Validation Error After Smart Downgrade**: When Thinking is disabled via smart downgrade (e.g., incompatible history), all Thinking blocks in historical messages are automatically converted to plain text, resolving "thinking is disabled but message contains thinking" errors.
            - **Fixed Model Switching Signature Error**: Added target model Thinking support detection. When switching from Claude thinking models to regular Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`), Thinking is automatically disabled and historical messages are downgraded to avoid "Corrupted thought signature" errors. Only models with `-thinking` suffix (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-thinking`) or Claude models support Thinking.
            - **Impact**: These fixes ensure stability across various model switching scenarios, especially for seamless Claude ↔ Gemini transitions.
        - **Account Rotation Rate-Limiting Mechanism Optimization (Critical Fix for Issue #278)**:
            - **Fixed Rate-Limit Time Parsing Failure**: Completely resolved the issue where Google API's `quotaResetDelay` could not be correctly parsed.
                - **Corrected JSON Parsing Path**: Fixed the extraction path for `quotaResetDelay` from `details[0].quotaResetDelay` to `details[0].metadata.quotaResetDelay`, matching Google API's actual JSON structure.
                - **Implemented Universal Time Parsing**: Added `parse_duration_string()` function to support parsing all time formats returned by Google API, including complex combinations like `"2h21m25.831582438s"`, `"1h30m"`, `"5m"`, `"30s"`, etc.
                - **Differentiated Rate-Limit Types**: Added `RateLimitReason` enum to distinguish between `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED` (quota exhausted) and `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (rate limit) types, setting different default wait times based on type (quota exhausted: 1 hour, rate limit: 30 seconds).
            - **Problem Before Fix**: When account quota was exhausted triggering 429 errors, the system could not parse the accurate reset time returned by Google API (e.g., `"2h21m25s"`), resulting in using a fixed default value of 60 seconds. Accounts were incorrectly considered "recoverable in 1 minute" when they actually needed 2 hours, causing accounts to fall into a 429 loop, using only the first 2 accounts while subsequent accounts were never utilized.
            - **Effect After Fix**: The system can now accurately parse the reset time returned by Google API (e.g., `"2h21m25.831582438s"` → 8485 seconds). Accounts are correctly marked as rate-limited and wait for the accurate time, ensuring all accounts can be properly rotated and used, completely resolving the "only using first 2 accounts" issue.
            - **Impact**: This fix significantly improves stability and availability in multi-account environments, ensuring all accounts are fully utilized and avoiding account rotation failures caused by rate-limit time parsing errors.
    *   **v3.3.12 (2026-01-02)**:
        - **Critical Fixes**:
            - **Fix Antigravity Thinking Signature Errors**: Completely resolved `400: thinking.signature: Field required` errors when using the Antigravity (Google API) channel.
                - **Disabled Dummy Thinking Block Injection**: Removed logic that auto-injected unsigned "Thinking..." placeholder blocks for historical messages. Google API rejects any thinking blocks without valid signatures.
                - **Removed Fake Signature Fallback**: Removed logic that added `skip_thought_signature_validator` sentinel values to ToolUse and Thinking blocks. Now only uses real signatures or omits the thoughtSignature field entirely.
                - **Fixed Background Task Misclassification**: Removed the "Caveat: The messages below were generated" keyword to prevent normal requests containing Claude Desktop system prompts from being misclassified as background tasks and downgraded to Flash Lite models.
                - **Impact**: This fix ensures stability for Claude CLI, Cursor, Cherry Studio, and other clients when using the Antigravity proxy, especially in multi-turn conversations and tool calling scenarios.
    *   **v3.3.11 (2026-01-02)**:
        - **Critical Fixes**:
            - **Cherry Studio Compatibility Fix (Gemini 3)**:
                - **Removed Forced Prompt Injection**: Removed the mandatory "Coding Agent" system instruction and Gemini 3 user message suffix injections. This resolves the issue where `gemini-3-flash` would output confused responses (like "Thinking Process" or "Actually, the instruction says...") in general-purpose clients like Cherry Studio. The generic OpenAI protocol now respects the original user prompt faithfully.
            - **Fix Gemini 3 Python Client Crash**:
                - **Removed maxOutputTokens Restriction**: Removed the logic that forcibly set `maxOutputTokens: 64000` for Gemini requests. This forced setting caused standard Gemini 3 Flash/Pro models (limit 8192) to reject requests and return empty responses, triggering `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` errors in Python clients. The proxy now defaults to the model's native limit or respects client parameters.
        - **Core Optimization**:
            - **Unified Retry Backoff System**: Refactored error retry logic with intelligent backoff strategies tailored to different error types:
                - **Thinking Signature Failure (400)**: Fixed 200ms delay before retry, avoiding request doubling from immediate retries.
                - **Server Overload (529/503)**: Exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s/8s), significantly improving recovery success rate by 167%.
                - **Rate Limiting (429)**: Prioritizes server-provided Retry-After, otherwise uses linear backoff (1s/2s/3s).
                - **Account Protection**: Server-side errors (529/503) no longer rotate accounts, preventing healthy account pool contamination.
                - **Unified Logging**: All backoff operations use ⏱️ identifier for easy monitoring and debugging.
        - **Critical Fix**:
            - **Fixed Gemini 3 Python Client Crash**: Removed the logic that forced `maxOutputTokens: 64000` for Gemini requests. This override caused standard Gemini 3 Flash/Pro models (limit 8192) to reject requests with empty responses, leading to `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` errors in Python clients. The proxy now defaults to model native limits or respects client parameters.
        - **Scoop Installation Compatibility Support (Core Thanks to @Small-Ku PR #252)**:
            - **Startup Arguments Configuration**: Added Antigravity startup arguments configuration feature. Users can now customize startup parameters in the Settings page, perfectly compatible with portable installations via package managers like Scoop.
            - **Smart Database Path Detection**: Optimized database path detection logic with priority-based checking:
                - Command-line specified `--user-data-dir` path
                - Portable mode `data/user-data` directory
                - System default paths (macOS/Windows/Linux)
            - **Multi-Installation Support**: Ensures correct database file location and access across standard installations, Scoop portable installations, and custom data directory scenarios.
        - **Browser Environment CORS Support Optimization (Core Thanks to @marovole PR #223)**:
            - **Explicit HTTP Method List**: Changed CORS middleware `allow_methods` from generic `Any` to explicit method list (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/HEAD/OPTIONS/PATCH), improving browser environment compatibility.
            - **Preflight Cache Optimization**: Added `max_age(3600)` configuration to cache CORS preflight requests for 1 hour, reducing unnecessary OPTIONS requests and improving performance.
            - **Security Enhancement**: Added `allow_credentials(false)` configuration, following security best practices when used with `allow_origin(Any)`.
            - **Browser Client Support**: Enhanced CORS support for browser-based AI clients like Droid, ensuring cross-origin API calls work properly.
        - **Account Table Drag-and-Drop Sorting (Core Thanks to @wanglei8888 PR #256)**:
            - **Drag to Reorder**: Added drag-and-drop sorting functionality for the account table. Users can now customize account display order by dragging table rows, making it easy to pin frequently used accounts to the top.
            - **Persistent Storage**: Custom sort order is automatically saved locally and persists across application restarts.
            - **Optimistic Updates**: Drag operations update the interface immediately for smooth user experience, while saving asynchronously in the background.
            - **Built with dnd-kit**: Implemented using the modern `@dnd-kit` library, supporting keyboard navigation and accessibility features.
    *   **v3.3.10 (2026-01-01)**:
        - 🌐 **Upstream Endpoint Fallback Mechanism** (Core Thanks to @karasungur PR #243):
            - **Multi-Endpoint Auto-Switching**: Implemented `prod → daily` dual-endpoint fallback strategy. Automatically switches to backup endpoint when primary returns 404/429/5xx, significantly improving service availability.
            - **Connection Pool Optimization**: Added `pool_max_idle_per_host(16)`, `tcp_keepalive(60s)` and other parameters to optimize connection reuse and reduce establishment overhead, especially optimized for WSL/Windows environments.
            - **Smart Retry Logic**: Supports automatic endpoint switching for 408 Request Timeout, 404 Not Found, 429 Too Many Requests, and 5xx Server Errors.
            - **Detailed Logging**: Records INFO logs on successful fallback and WARN logs on failures for operational monitoring and troubleshooting.
            - **Fully Compatible with Scheduling Modes**: Endpoint fallback and account scheduling (Cache First/Balance/Performance First) work at different layers without interference, ensuring cache hit rates remain unaffected.
        - 📊 **Comprehensive Logging System Optimization**:
            - **Log Level Restructuring**: Strictly separated INFO/DEBUG/TRACE levels. INFO now only shows critical business information, with detailed debugging downgraded to DEBUG.
            - **Heartbeat Request Filtering**: Downgraded heartbeat requests (`/api/event_logging/batch`, `/healthz`) from INFO to TRACE, completely eliminating log noise.
            - **Account Information Display**: Shows account email at request start and completion for easy monitoring of account usage and session stickiness debugging.
            - **Streaming Response Completion Markers**: Added completion logs for streaming responses (including token statistics), ensuring full request lifecycle traceability.
            - **90%+ Log Volume Reduction**: Normal requests reduced from 50+ lines to 3-5 lines, startup logs from 30+ to 6 lines, dramatically improving readability.
            - **Debug Mode**: Use `RUST_LOG=debug` to view full request/response JSON for deep debugging.
        - 🎨 **Imagen 3 Generation Enhancements**:
            - **New Resolution Support**: Added support for `-2k` resolution via model name suffixes for higher definitions.
            - **Ultra-wide Aspect Ratio**: Added support for `-21x9` (or `-21-9`) aspect ratio, perfect for ultra-wide displays.
            - **Mapping Optimization**: Improved auto-mapping logic for custom sizes like `2560x1080`.
            - **Full Protocol Coverage**: These enhancements are available across OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini protocols.
        - 🔍 **Model Detection API**:
            - **New Detection Endpoint**: Introduced `POST /v1/models/detect` to reveal model capabilities and configuration variants in real-time.
            - **Dynamic Model List**: The `/v1/models` API now dynamically lists all resolution and aspect ratio combinations for image models (e.g., `gemini-3-pro-image-4k-21x9`).
        - 🐛 **Background Task Downgrade Model Fix**:
            - **Fixed 404 Errors**: Corrected background task downgrade model from non-existent `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, resolving 404 errors for title generation, summaries, and other background tasks.
        - 🔐 **Manual Account Disable Feature**:
            - **Independent Disable Control**: Added manual account disable feature, distinct from 403 disable. Only affects proxy pool, not API requests.
            - **Application Usable**: Manually disabled accounts can still be switched and used within the application, view quota details, only removed from proxy pool.
            - **Visual Distinction**: 403 disable shows red "Disabled" badge, manual disable shows orange "Proxy Disabled" badge.
            - **Batch Operations**: Supports batch disable/enable multiple accounts for improved management efficiency.
            - **Auto Reload**: Automatically reloads proxy account pool after disable/enable operations, takes effect immediately.
            - **Impact Scope**: Lightweight tasks including title generation, simple summaries, system messages, prompt suggestions, and environment probes now correctly downgrade to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`.
        - 🎨 **UI Experience Enhancements**:
            - **Unified Dialog Style**: Standardized all native alert/confirm dialogs in the ApiProxy page to application-standard Toast notifications and ModalDialogs, improving visual consistency.
            - **Tooltip Clipping Fixed**: Resolved the issue where tooltips in the Proxy Settings page (e.g., "Scheduling Mode", "Allow LAN Access") were obstructed by container boundaries.
